# NAT (Network Address Translation)

This folder contains my Cisco Packet Tracer labs focused on **Network Address Translation (NAT)** concepts covered in the CCNA 200-301 certification.

The goal of these labs is to understand how private networks communicate with external networks using public IP addresses. The labs progress from one-to-one address translation, to dynamic allocation of public IP addresses, and finally to Port Address Translation (PAT), the most widely deployed NAT implementation in modern networks.

## Labs

### 01 - Static NAT

Configured a permanent one-to-one mapping between an internal web server and a dedicated public IP address. This lab demonstrates how organizations publish internal services while keeping private addressing schemes hidden.

**Topics Covered**

- Static NAT
- Inside Local vs Inside Global Addresses
- Router-on-a-Stick
- Inter-VLAN Routing
- Public Web Server Publishing
- NAT Verification

---

### 02 - Dynamic NAT

Configured a pool of public IP addresses that are dynamically assigned to internal hosts as they access external networks. This lab demonstrates how available public addresses are temporarily allocated and released when no longer in use.

**Topics Covered**

- Dynamic NAT
- NAT Pools
- Standard ACLs
- Dynamic Address Translation
- NAT Verification

---

### 03 - PAT (NAT Overload)

Configured Port Address Translation (PAT) to allow multiple internal hosts to simultaneously share a single public IP address using unique source port numbers. This is the most commonly deployed NAT implementation in SOHO and enterprise environments.

**Topics Covered**

- PAT (NAT Overload)
- Interface-Based NAT
- Port Address Translation
- IPv4 Address Conservation
- NAT Verification

---

## What I Learned

Through these labs, I gained hands-on experience configuring and verifying the three primary NAT implementations used in IPv4 networks.

The progression from Static NAT to Dynamic NAT and finally PAT reinforced how each translation method addresses different networking requirements while conserving public IPv4 address space.

Each lab includes:

- Objectives
- Network topology
- Configuration snippets
- Verification screenshots
- Key concepts learned
